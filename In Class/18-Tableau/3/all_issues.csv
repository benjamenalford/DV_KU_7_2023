15645099,Acknowledged,Traffic Signal Repair,The sensors at the intersection of Huntoon and Washburn are very broken. Cars are backed up for blocks on the regular because the sensors moving East on Huntoon do not work well at all. Cars can sit for 10 minutes before everyone gets desperate and starts turning right just to get out of the line. One morning it was so bad that an officer in traffic escorted us all through.

if a city worker could please enter the home and turn off the light and see if there are any honeless still living there. and please close the window. or board it up so that rain snow sleet hail do not further destroy the property. has there been any luck in contacting the homeowner Mr Penner? is it possible to give his contact information, address or phone number that I may speak to him? I thought the power to the home was already shut off the same way the water was? are we sure they're not homeless people in there still? I'm sorry to be annoying but the law states that I cannot do anything I must follow the proper channels and so I'm doing such. please kill the power to the unoccupied residency and vacate any vagrants. is Mr Penner still paying electricity at this property? you know he's not paying his property tax. so it seem a little bit odd that he's funding electricity. doesn't add up.

15587464,Closed,General Feedback or Questions,I've lived here for 17 years and I'll never understand why Topeka Boulevard is in such terrible road surface condition from one end to the other.  This is one of the main streets in Topeka yet it is destructive to vehicles to try to travel on it.  Your priorities are horrible in my opinion about your choices of where you spend the tax money you have us paying for streets.  You don't even try to maintain the streets we have.  Summer has come and gone again and I've seen at most one street repair truck out.  When they do a repair in an area they will poorly patch a few holes and leave that many more untouched.  You've done the same thing through the years with the water lines.  You neglect our systems until they literally crash and then it costs three times as much to put a band aid on it as it would have to have properly maintained it.,39.0497201769812,-95.67176,Topeka City Hall,2023-11-08 18:21:08+00:00,2023-11-13 15:35:41+00:00,2023-11-17 16:50:38+00:00,https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/15587464,"{'video_url': None, 'image_full': None, 'image_square_100x100': None, 'representative_image_url': 'https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/pothole-e09869431979395692cc8e63399760868f40c06b83c09dfc701458aa1412bce8.png'}",4 days 21:14:33.000000000,8 days 22:29:30.000000000

14098705,Acknowledged,Change of intersection signage. (City Engineering),"Can city engineers look at redesigning this intersection for traffic control. Harrison Ave. is a 3 lane round with only about 1 car every hour or so, even during rush hour. That should not have the right-of-way, rather 7th street is used for a lot of state workers as well as tons of people cutting from topeka blvd over towards Kansas. Personally, cutting Harrison down to a 2-lane or a single lane from 6th up to 8th would be best with a stop sign designated for Harrison Ave. to stop and give 7th street the right of way to cross. You can even extend out the sidewalk and do those protected sections like the new road work on 12th street has for the parking. This would also alleviate the issues where people going east from topeka blvd being blinded by the sun in the morning and not being able to see past the parking people at the abandoned yellow hotel. The 3 lanes probably made more sense when that bank and the antique mall used to be open, but now that the crime and homeless issues have driven business out of downtown topeka blvd, a 3 lane road with no traffic having the right-of-way is ridiculous. Also, as the only real business on Harrison is the car import shop, you may look at converting harrison from a 1-way road to 2-way with a turn lane in the center from 4th street up to 6th street. The amount of drivers I watch on a daily basis going the wrong way on Harrison to go north to the parking lot where the school bus drops off kids is too many. Engineering can look at safety if the street is just restriped in this area.",39.0513490341197,-95.6781665502578,"Sw 7th St & Sw Harrison St Topeka, KS, 66603, USA",2023-02-21 14:38:43+00:00,2023-02-21 14:38:46+00:00,,https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/14098705,"{'video_url': None, 'image_full': None, 'image_square_100x100': None, 'representative_image_url': 'https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/signs-3b1fbd7c0827d225d542f5d5261fecd44f62526a8087b0372f397a12d6069c0e.png'}",0 days 00:00:03.000000000,
