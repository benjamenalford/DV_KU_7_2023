# SF311 Cases

In this activity, you will calculate the total number of cases opened per year and plot the results after converting from a Spark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame.

## Instructions

The instructions for this activity are divided into two parts. In Part 1, you’ll find the total number of opened cases per year. In Part 2, you’ll plot the year and cases.

### Part 1: Calculate Total Cases

1. Using the SF311 cases data, import the time functions and load in the DataFrame.

2. Create a new DataFrame with the column `Year`.

3. Save Year as a new column.

4. Find the total number of opened cases per year.

### Part 2: Plot the Results

1. Import the summarized data to a Pandas DataFrame for plotting.

2. Clean the data and rename the column "count" to "Cases".

3. Plot the year and Cases.
