  * Create a bucket name and choose the region.

  * **Note:** The bucket name must be unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3. Buckets cannot be renamed or created inside of another bucket.

  * Leave the region as the default `US East (N. Virginia)`. Changing the region will change the object URL used in all examples today.
