# Checking AWS Billing

If you shut down everything in AWS, you should not accrue any costs. To ensure that you have properly shut down all AWS services, follow these steps.

1. In the AWS Management Console, search for Billing and click the result.

2. On the Billing & Cost Management dashboard, scroll down to find your Spend Summary. This summary is only a forecast and does not reflect what you will be charged. It also doesn't apply to your AWS free usage credits. The amount displayed should not be more than a few dollars.

3. Scroll further down to find the Top Free Tier Services by Usage section.Check hat all your services are within the Free Tier Usage. If you are close to the limit or if your usage is higher than expected for any services, delete them and limit future usage for the month.

For the next few months, check your AWS statements and the Bills page to make sure that there are no surprise costs or reoccurring paid services.
