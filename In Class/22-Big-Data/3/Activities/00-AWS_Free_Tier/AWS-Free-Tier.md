# Amazon Web Services Free Tier

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has three types of free offers, depending on the product that you choose: Free Tier, 12 months free, and trials. The details of each free offering can be found on the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier/).

The activities in this module use Free Tier services. However, be aware that you can still [incur charges](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/control-your-costs-free-tier-budgets/) while using the Free Tier.

Before you sign up and use any AWS Free Tier service, make sure you review all the services and resources covered under [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). AWS provides additional information on how to avoid charges in their [Getting Started guide](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/control-your-costs-free-tier-budgets/).
