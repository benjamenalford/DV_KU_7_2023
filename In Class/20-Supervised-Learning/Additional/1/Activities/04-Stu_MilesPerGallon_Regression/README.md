# Miles Per Gallon

In this activity, you'll calculate a regression line to predict miles per gallon based on vehicle specifications.

## Instructions

* Start by creating a scatter plot of different variables along with `MPG` to illustrate if any linear trend exists.

* Split the data into training and testing data by using the sklearn `train_test_split()` function.

* Use the linear regression model of sklearn to fit the model to the training data.

* Use the test data to make new predictions. Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) and the R-squared (R2) score for those predictions.

* Use `model.score()` to calculate the R2 score for the test data.
