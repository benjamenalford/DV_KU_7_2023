# Counterfeit Catcher

In this activity, you'll apply logistic regression to predict whether a particular banknote is counterfeit or legitimate by using computed features from digitized images.

## Instructions

* Use the starter file [Counterfeit-Detection.ipynb](Unsolved/Counterfeit-Detection.ipynb) with the [data_banknote_authentication.csv](Resources/data_banknote_authentication.csv) dataset.

* Split your data into training and testing data.

* Create a logistic regression model with sklearn.

* Fit the model to the training data.

* Make 10 predictions, and then compare them to the testing data labels.

* Compute the accuracy score for the training and the testing data separately.
